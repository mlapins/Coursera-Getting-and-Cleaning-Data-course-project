# Coursera-Getting and Cleaning Data

Tidy data course project

The purpose of this script (...project) is to demonstrate collecting data and working with the data to create a clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This script does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

In this repository is:
- run_analysis.R - This is the R code that performs the above tasks.
- CodeBook.md - This file summarises the fields in the tidydata.tx
- tidydata.txt - This is copy of the file uploaded for this assignment
